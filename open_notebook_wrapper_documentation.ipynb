    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The wrapper script acts as a bridge between your host system and the Open Notebook CLI running inside the Docker container. It forwards your commands to the container and returns the results, making it seamless to interact with Open Notebook without having to connect to the container directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No modifications to the container are required\n",
    "2. You can run commands directly from your host terminal\n",
    "3. The script can be integrated with other host-side tools and scripts\n",
    "4. It handles the container interaction details for you"

    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using the wrapper script, make sure to set it as executable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "chmod +x open_notebook_wrapper.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The script assumes that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Docker is installed and running on your system\n",
    "2. The Open Notebook container is running with the name `assistant-notebook-1`\n",
    "3. The Open Notebook CLI script (`open_notebook_cli.py`) is available in the container's working directory"
