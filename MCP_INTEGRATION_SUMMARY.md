# MCP Server Integration Summary

## Overview

We've successfully extended the `lfnovo/open_notebook:latest` Docker image to embed a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This enables direct functional access from within the notebook environment, eliminating the need for an auxiliary API.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Analysis of Base Image

We analyzed the source `Dockerfile` of `lfnovo/open_notebook:latest` and identified:
- The image is based on Python 3.11 slim
- Uses the uv package manager for Python dependencies
- Exposes port 8502 for the Streamlit app
- Workdir is set to /app
- The entire repository is copied to /app

### 2. Conflict Resolution Strategies

To avoid integration conflicts, we implemented:
- **Port conflicts**: Used a different port (8001) for the MCP server to avoid conflict with SurrealDB (8000)
- **Dependency issues**: Used the same package manager (uv) as the base image
- **Entrypoint conflicts**: Used supervisord to manage multiple processes
- **Path issues**: Added PYTHONPATH environment variable and installed the package in dev mode

### 3. MCP Server Implementation

The MCP server:
- Is implemented using FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Exposes API endpoints for tool discovery and execution
- Dynamically loads tools from the CLI
- Is conditionally started based on the ENABLE_MCP_SERVER environment variable

### 4. CLI Integration

The CLI integration:
- CLI script is copied to the container
- Tool registry can execute CLI commands
- MCP server loads tool definitions from CLI
- Tools can be executed via API calls

### 5. Docker Compose Configuration

We updated docker-compose.yml to:
- Use the new image with appropriate tags
- Expose the MCP server port
- Set environment variables for MCP server activation
- Include volume mounts for data persistence

## Usage Instructions

### Environment Variables

- `ENABLE_MCP_SERVER`: Controls MCP server activation (true/false)
- `MCP_SERVER_PORT`: Sets the port for the MCP server (default: 8001)

### API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Root endpoint
- `GET /health`: Health check endpoint
- `GET /tools`: List available tools
- `GET /tools/{tool_name}`: Get details about a specific tool
- `POST /execute/{tool_name}`: Execute a tool with parameters

### Building the Image

```bash
docker build -t open_notebook_mcp:latest -f Dockerfile.mcp .
```

### Running with Docker Compose

```bash
# Multi-container setup
docker compose --profile multi up

# Single container setup
docker compose --profile single up
```

## Verification Tests

We've created a comprehensive test script (`test_mcp_integration.sh`) that verifies:
1. MCP server activation when enabled
2. MCP server deactivation when disabled
3. Notebook functionality with MCP server enabled
4. CLI integration via the MCP server API
