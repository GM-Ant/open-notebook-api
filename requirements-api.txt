# Add other dependencies from open_notebook_cli.py if they are not already covered
# For example, if open_notebook_cli.py uses 'requests', 'numpy', etc., add them here.
# Assuming open_notebook_cli.py and its dependencies are part of the same project environment
# and will be available when the Docker image is built or when run locally.
# We need to ensure that any libraries imported by open_notebook_cli.py are listed here
# or in the main project's pyproject.toml / requirements.txt if it's shared.

# Based on the provided context, open_notebook_cli.py seems to be a standalone script
# that might import from other local modules (e.g., open_notebook.domain.models.Notebook).
# Ensure these are correctly packaged or available in the PYTHONPATH.

# For now, this is minimal for the API itself.
# Dependencies of open_notebook_cli.py must be handled by the project setup.
