# MCP Integration Fix Summary

This document summarizes the fixes made to integrate the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with the Open Notebook Docker image.

## Issues Identified

1. **Python Module Import Error**: The MCP server was failing to find the `open_notebook.tool_registry` module because the Python package was not properly installed in the container.
2. **Supervisord Configuration**: The supervisord configuration had issues with the path to the config file and was being modified by the start script in a way that caused failures.
3. **Missing setup.py**: There was no setup.py file, so the `uv pip install -e .` command could not properly install the open_notebook package.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created setup.py file

Added a proper setup.py file to enable installation of the open_notebook package:

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="open-notebook",
    version="0.1.0",
    packages=find_packages(),
    include_package_data=True,
)
```

### 2. Updated Dockerfile.mcp

Modified the Dockerfile to improve the package installation process:

- Added verification steps to ensure the package is installed correctly
- Changed the order of copy operations to prioritize the package files
- Corrected the path to the supervisord configuration file
- Added a step to copy the setup.py file

### 3. Fixed supervisord.mcp.conf

Updated the supervisord configuration file:

- Added `user=root` to ensure proper permissions
- Ensured all paths and environment variables are correctly set

### 4. Improved start_services.sh

Enhanced the startup script:

- Removed the section that modified the supervisord configuration file
- Added Python path debugging to help diagnose issues
- Added package import testing to verify proper installation
- Properly sets environment variables without modifying config files

### 5. Enhanced test_mcp_integration.sh

Updated the test script to:

- Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile.mcp before testing
- Display container logs for better debugging
- Provide more detailed output when tests fail
- Include a summary and instructions for manual testing

## Testing Procedure

To test the MCP integration, run:

```bash
chmod +x test_mcp_integration.sh
./test_mcp_integration.sh
```

This will:
1. Build the Docker image from Dockerfile.mcp
2. Test the MCP server with ENABLE_MCP_SERVER=true
3. Test the MCP server with ENABLE_MCP_SERVER=false
4. Verify that the notebook remains accessible

## Manual Testing

For manual testing and debugging, you can run:

```bash
docker build -t open_notebook_mcp:latest -f Dockerfile.mcp .
docker run --rm -it -p 8502:8502 -p 8001:8001 -e ENABLE_MCP_SERVER=true open_notebook_mcp:latest
```

Then in another terminal, test the MCP server with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

And the notebook with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8502
```
