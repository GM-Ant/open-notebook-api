    "## Root Cause Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "After investigating, the issue is related to VS Code extension settings. The root cause is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A VS Code extension called \"roo-cline\" is installed\n",
    "2. This extension has MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configurations in the settings\n",
    "3. One of these configurations is for a \"sequential-thinking\" MCP server\n",
    "4. This configuration is somehow being picked up by Docker Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration is located in:\n",
    "`/Users/gregory/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json`\n",
    "\n",

    "## Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are several ways to fix the issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Temporarily Disable the VS Code Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "Disable the \"roo-cline\" extension when working with Docker in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Isolate Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Run Docker Compose with a clean environment that doesn't include VS Code settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "env -i HOME=$HOME PATH=$PATH docker compose --profile multi up --build\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 3: Add the Service to Docker Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to keep using the sequential thinking capabilities, properly define the service in `docker-compose.yml`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",

    "  # ... existing services ...\n",

    "    profiles: [multi]\n",
